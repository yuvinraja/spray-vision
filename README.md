## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.10+
- Required packages listed in `requirements.txt`

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd spray-vision
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## How to Use

### Quick Start (Automated with Makefile)

The project includes a comprehensive Makefile for easy automation. Here are the key commands:

#### **Initial Setup**
```bash
# Complete project setup (creates directories, installs dependencies, checks data)
make setup

# Install development dependencies with optional features
make dev-requirements
```

#### **Data Processing & Training**
```bash
# Run data preprocessing pipeline
make preprocess

# Train classical ML models
make train-ml

# Train artificial neural network
make train-ann

# Run complete pipeline (preprocessing + all training)
make train-all
```

#### **Development & Testing**
```bash
# Start Jupyter notebook server
make notebook

# Test all notebooks without saving outputs
make test-notebooks

# Check project status and files
make report

# Clean temporary files and cache
make clean
```

#### **Dependency Management**
```bash
# Install basic requirements
make requirements

# Update requirements.txt from current environment
make freeze-requirements
```

### Manual Usage (Step-by-Step)

If you prefer to run things manually or need more control:

#### **1. Environment Setup**
```bash
# Create virtual environment (optional but recommended)
python -m venv .venv
.venv\Scripts\activate  # Windows
# source .venv/bin/activate  # Linux/Mac

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Or install with optional features
pip install -e ".[dev,viz,extra]"
```

#### **2. Data Preparation**
```bash
# Ensure raw data exists
# Place DataSheet_ETH_250902.xlsx in data/raw/

# Create necessary directories
mkdir -p data/processed data/interim models outputs

# Run preprocessing notebook
jupyter nbconvert --to notebook --execute notebooks/data-preprocessing-pipeline.ipynb
```

#### **3. Model Training**

**Classical ML Models:**
```bash
# Execute ML pipeline notebook
jupyter nbconvert --to notebook --execute notebooks/ml-pipeline.ipynb

# This will generate:
# - Trained model files in models/
# - Performance metrics in outputs/
```

**Neural Network:**
```bash
# Execute ANN pipeline notebook
jupyter nbconvert --to notebook --execute notebooks/ann-pipeline.ipynb

# This will generate:
# - ANN model files (.h5 format)
# - Scaler files for input/output normalization
# - Performance comparisons
```

#### **4. Interactive Development**
```bash
# Start Jupyter for interactive development
jupyter notebook notebooks/

# Or use Jupyter Lab
jupyter lab notebooks/
```

### Project Workflow

1. **Data Preprocessing** (`data-preprocessing-pipeline.ipynb`)
   - Loads raw ETH spray dataset from Excel
   - Performs data cleaning and preprocessing
   - Saves processed data to `data/processed/`

2. **Classical ML Training** (`ml-pipeline.ipynb`)
   - Trains multiple ML algorithms
   - Performs hyperparameter tuning
   - Evaluates and compares models
   - Saves best models to `models/`

3. **Neural Network Training** (`ann-pipeline.ipynb`)
   - Implements standard and improved ANN architectures
   - Trains with proper validation splits
   - Saves trained networks and scalers
   - Generates prediction comparisons

4. **Results Analysis**
   - Review `outputs/overall_model_metrics.csv` for model comparison
   - Check `outputs/per_target_metrics.csv` for detailed performance
   - Examine actual vs predicted values in output CSV files

### Troubleshooting

**Common Issues:**

- **Missing data file**: Ensure `DataSheet_ETH_250902.xlsx` is in `data/raw/`
- **Import errors**: Run `make requirements` or `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- **Notebook execution fails**: Try `make test-notebooks` to identify issues
- **Memory issues**: Close other applications, consider smaller batch sizes in ANN training

**Getting Help:**
```bash
# See all available Makefile commands
make help

# Check project status
make report

# Verify data and model files
make check-data
make check-models
```

## Results & Outputs

After running the complete pipeline, you'll find several important files:

### Model Files (`models/` directory)
- **Classical ML Models**: `*.joblib` files (RandomForest, SVM, etc.)
- **Neural Networks**: `*.h5` files for trained ANN models
- **Scalers**: `*_scaler.joblib` files for input/output normalization

### Performance Metrics (`outputs/` directory)
- **`overall_model_metrics.csv`**: Comprehensive comparison of all models
- **`per_target_metrics.csv`**: Detailed performance per prediction target
- **`ANN_improved_predictions.csv`**: Best model predictions
- **`ANN_improved_actuals.csv`**: Corresponding actual values

### Interpreting Results
- **R² Score**: Higher is better (closer to 1.0 indicates better fit)
- **MAE (Mean Absolute Error)**: Lower is better (average prediction error)
- **MSE (Mean Squared Error)**: Lower is better (penalizes larger errors more)

### Expected Performance
The project typically achieves:
- Classical ML models: R² scores ranging from 0.7-0.9
- Neural Networks: Often the best performing with R² > 0.9
- Best models are automatically saved for future use

## Configuration

The project uses:
- `pyproject.toml` for package configuration
- `Makefile` for automation tasks
- Joblib for model serialization
- HDF5 format for neural network models
